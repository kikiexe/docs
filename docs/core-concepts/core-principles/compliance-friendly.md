# Compliance Friendly

Veilfi bridges the gap between privacy and regulatory compliance through **Zero-Knowledge KYC**, enabling institutional adoption without sacrificing user privacy.

## Why Compliance Matters

### Institutional Barriers

DAOs, treasuries, and funds need compliance:

- Regulatory requirements (SEC, FinCEN, MiCA)
- Fiduciary duties to stakeholders
- Auditor requirements
- Insurance prerequisites

**Without Compliance**: Institutions locked out of DeFi yields.

## ZK-KYC: The Bridge

### How It Works

```
User completes KYC → Provider issues certificate → User generates ZK proof
                                                            ↓
                                    Blockchain verifies: "User is KYC'd"
                                    Blockchain CANNOT see: Identity details
```

**Result**: Compliance without surveillance.

### Tiered Access

| Tier          | Deposit Limit | KYC Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Retail        | < 10 ETH      | ❌ Optional  |
| Institutional | > 10 ETH      | ✅ Required  |

**Flexibility**: Small users = no friction; large users = compliant.

## Regulatory Advantages
