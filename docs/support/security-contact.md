# Security Contact

Report security vulnerabilities and help make Veilfi safer.

## Report a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### Email

**security@veilfi.xyz** _(placeholder for hackathon)_

For critical security issues only.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability:

1. **Clear description** of the issue
2. **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Your contact info** for follow-up (optional)
5. **Suggested fix** if you have one

### Response Timeline

**Current (Hackathon Phase)**:

- We'll review reports as quickly as possible
- This is a demo on testnet - no real funds at risk
- Fixes will be implemented before mainnet

**After Mainnet Launch**:

- Acknowledgment within 24-48 hours
- Regular updates on fix progress
- Coordinated disclosure timeline

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

### Guidelines

✅ **Please do**:

- Report privately first (email us)
- Give reasonable time to fix (suggest 90 days)
- Follow up if no response
- Test on testnet only

❌ **Please don't**:

- Publicly disclose before fix
- Exploit vulnerabilities on mainnet
- Test with real user funds
- Demand payment for reports

### Disclosure Process

1. **Report** → Send to security@veilfi.xyz
2. **Acknowledge** → We confirm receipt
3. **Investigate** → We assess severity
4. **Fix** → We develop and test patch
5. **Deploy** → We roll out fix
6. **Disclose** → Public disclosure after fix

## Known Limitations

**Current Status: Hackathon Demo**

This is a **testnet deployment** for demonstration purposes:

⚠️ **Not audited** - No professional security audit yet  
⚠️ **Testnet only** - Do not use with real funds  
⚠️ **Active development** - Code may change frequently  
⚠️ **No guarantees** - Use at your own risk

**Before mainnet**, we will:

- Conduct professional security audit
- Implement all recommended fixes
- Set up comprehensive testing
- Establish proper security processes

## Security Roadmap

### Pre-Mainnet (Q2 2024)

- [ ] Professional smart contract audit
- [ ] ZK circuit security review
- [ ] Frontend security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Bug bounty program establishment

### Post-Mainnet

- [ ] Ongoing monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Community bug bounty (if funded)
- [ ] Quarterly security reviews

## For Researchers

Interested in security research on Veilfi?

**What we need help with**:

- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- ZK circuit weaknesses
- Frontend security issues
- Infrastructure vulnerabilities
- Economic attack vectors

**Current rewards**: None (hackathon demo phase)  
**Future**: Bug bounty program after mainnet + funding

## Emergency Contact

**Critical live exploit on mainnet?**

_(Not applicable yet - we're on testnet)_

Once on mainnet:

1. Email security@veilfi.xyz immediately
2. Mark subject: "URGENT - Active Exploit"
3. Include proof-of-concept details

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When Veilfi launches on mainnet:

**Protect Yourself**:

- Start with small test deposits
- Use hardware wallet for large amounts
- Verify contract addresses carefully
- Never share private keys
- Use VPN for additional privacy

**Stay Safe**:

- Only use official website
- Beware of phishing attempts
- Double-check transaction details
- Understand the risks (see [Known Risks](/docs/security/known-risks))

### For Developers

If integrating with Veilfi:

**Best Practices**:

- Test on testnet first
- Audit integration code
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor for security updates
- Follow security announcements

## Transparency

We believe in **transparent security**:

✅ Open source code (repo will be public)  
✅ Honest about limitations  
✅ Clear risk disclosure  
✅ Regular updates on security status

No security through obscurity - we want the community to help us find and fix issues.
